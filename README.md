# Burst pressure equations for pipes with interacting flaws

### Two cases considered: (1) two cracks (CC) (2) crack with wall loss corrosionc (CW)

This is the code for the burst pressure equations using simulation data. Only main Python and helper MATLAB functions are uploaded on GitHub and the raw burst pressure data from simulations are stored on Brown University Dataverse with assigned [DOI](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RBLAXD).

**Abaqus_script** contains the abaqus script to generate Abaqus simulation data in an automatic way. See the comments in the script for more information.

**MATLAB** contains helper functions in MATLAB.
